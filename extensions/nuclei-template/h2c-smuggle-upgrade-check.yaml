# 1. Nuclei force adds a "Connection: close" which will break this check.
# 2. Prefer usage on SSL/TLS web services. Using on cleartext services may result
# in a false positive by upgrading the connection to the edge server rather
# than to the backend server.
# 3. Each respective path on the webserver may result in a distinct proxypass.
# Some may be vulnerable while other might not.
